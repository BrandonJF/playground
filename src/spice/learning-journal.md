### Project Kickoff
- As a product engineer working on a personal weekend side project, I set out to optimally organize my seasoning cabinets, which have many jars and limited shelf space.
- The goal is to distribute jars alphabetically across multiple shelves, but the distribution of jars by letter is highly uneven (e.g., A–H has 70% of jars).

### Initial Approach
- Implemented a React component to track jar counts by letter and distribute them across shelves.
- The first version grouped consecutive letters, but this led to very uneven shelves when some letters were much more common.
- Added a fuzzy search/autocomplete field to quickly add spices by name, using a structured data source generated from a markdown list.

### Problems Faced
- The initial shelf distribution logic did not account for uneven jar counts, resulting in overloaded shelves for common letters.
- Encountered a React warning: "Maximum update depth exceeded" due to including a non-stable array in useEffect dependencies. Fixed by moving the array outside the component.
- State updates for letter counts were inconsistent between search and button-based additions. Refactored to use a consistent state update pattern.

### Key Learnings
- For optimal shelf balancing, a linear partition algorithm is needed to split the alphabet into contiguous groups that minimize the largest shelf's jar count.
- React state dependencies and array stability are important to avoid infinite render loops.
- Consistent state update patterns help prevent subtle bugs when multiple UI elements can update the same state.
- As a product engineer, I found that collaborating with AI on data operations and organization is most effective when I provide clear intent and context, allowing the AI to make accurate inferences while I ensure the solution fits real-world needs.

### Next Steps
- Continue to document new problems, solutions, and insights as the project evolves.
- Consider writing a retrospective or guide based on this journal at the end of the project.

### List Normalization and User-Friendly Naming
- Decided to use a "head noun first" format for all spice names (e.g., "Salt, Onion" instead of "Onion Salt") to make searching and organization more intuitive, both digitally and physically.
- Removed duplicates and ensured only one canonical form for each spice or blend remains in the markdown data source.
- Realized that some forms (like "Powder") should be treated as a descriptor, not the main identity, so items like "Miso Powder" are filed under "Miso" rather than "Powder".
- Updated the spice list to reflect these conventions, making it more natural for both digital search and physical organization.
- As a product engineer (even on a weekend side project), I noted the importance of nuance and context when collaborating with AI on data operations and organization—AI can make accurate inferences, but clear intent and human perspective are crucial for optimal results.

### Data Persistence & Public Asset Configuration
- Encountered a critical issue with our spicelist.md file not loading properly - when fetching from `/spicelist.md`, we were getting back HTML content instead.
- Realized the issue was that static assets need to be in the public directory for Vite to serve them correctly at the root path.
- Created a proper `public/` directory and moved the spicelist.md file there to resolve the 404 issue.
- Updated Vite configuration to include better path aliases and improved developer experience settings.
- Learned that understanding build tool conventions for static assets is critical for React/Vite applications.

### Implementing Persistent Storage
- Added complete localStorage functionality to automatically save and restore user data.
- Implemented a save status indicator showing when data is being saved, saved successfully, or if there was an error.
- Added a 500ms debounce to prevent excessive storage operations during rapid changes.
- Created separate UI controls: Reset to clear counters but keep data, and Clear All to remove from localStorage.
- Added last saved timestamp for better user feedback.

### Inventory Tracking Redesign
- Completely redesigned the app to track specific spices in the inventory rather than abstract letter counts.
- Removed the plus/minus buttons in favor of an explicit inventory system that shows exactly what was added.
- Stored unique identifiers and timestamps for each added spice to support proper removal functionality.
- Created a scrollable inventory view that clearly shows which spices are in the collection.
- Reordered the interface components to prioritize distribution information over inventory details.

### UI Refinements
- Improved the distribution visualization to display single letters properly when a shelf only contains one letter (e.g., "A" instead of "A-A").
- Created a clearer visual hierarchy with the configuration at top, distribution information in the middle, and detailed inventory at the bottom.
- Added color-coding for letters with spices (blue) versus empty letters (gray) for better visual scanning.
- Used consistent UI patterns for interactive elements to improve usability.

### Lessons Learned
- Static assets like data files should be placed in the public directory for proper serving in Vite applications.
- For real user value, tracking specific items rather than abstract counters provides much better utility.
- The localStorage API provides a straightforward way to add persistence without server infrastructure.
- When working with ranges in UI, treating edge cases (like single-item ranges) improves clarity.
- Breaking components into logical sections with consistent visual styling helps users navigate complex interfaces.

### Keyboard Shortcut Implementation
- Added numerical keyboard shortcuts (1-9) to quickly add spices from search results without using the mouse.
- Applied blue numbered buttons to visually indicate which number key corresponds to each result.
- Used minimum width for buttons to ensure consistency and visual clarity across the interface.
- Improved adding workflow by allowing the user to keep one hand on the keyboard when handling physical spices with the other hand.
- Learned that small UX improvements like keyboard shortcuts can dramatically enhance efficiency for repetitive tasks.

### Enhanced Fuzzy Search Algorithm
- Implemented a sophisticated fuzzy search algorithm to better match search queries with available spices.
- Added support for character-skipping matches (e.g., "gngr" matching "ginger"), making it easier to find spices with minimal typing.
- Incorporated multi-term search support to match spices containing multiple words, regardless of order.
- Created a smart scoring system that prioritizes:
  - Exact matches
  - Matches at the beginning of words or after commas/spaces
  - Longer relative matches
  - Earlier position matches
- Discovered the importance of flexible pattern matching for physical-world tasks where typing might be difficult or abbreviated.

### Custom Spice Addition Feature
- Added functionality to add custom spices not found in the predefined database.
- Implemented a prominent "Add [custom]" option at the top of search results with the keyboard shortcut "0".
- Used distinct green styling to differentiate custom additions from regular search results.
- Created a seamless workflow that handles both database matches and custom entries in a unified interface.
- Realized that real-world inventories often contain unique or specialized items not in standardized lists, making custom addition essential for a complete solution.

### User Experience Optimization
- Reordered UI components to prioritize the most valuable information (distribution) over details (inventory list).
- Added visual cues for interactive elements with distinct coloring and hover states.
- Improved empty states with helpful explanatory text.
- Maintained consistent patterns for user interactions, such as the keyboard shortcut system.
- Observed that the application now represents a complete solution for the initial problem statement, balancing:
  - Discoverability (searching/finding spices)
  - Efficiency (keyboard shortcuts)
  - Automation (optimal distribution calculation)
  - Persistence (automatic saving)
  - Flexibility (custom spice addition)

### Edge Case Handling for Shelf Distribution

- Fixed a failing test case that expected an empty array when the number of shelves is set to 0.
- Made a practical design decision to enforce a minimum of 1 shelf, even if a user attempts to set it to 0 or a negative number.
- Updated the test suite to reflect this requirement by validating that:
  - The `setNumShelves()` method enforces a minimum of 1 shelf
  - Calling `getNumShelves()` after setting to 0 correctly returns 1
  - The distribution calculation methods still return valid results
- The implementation uses `Math.max(1, num)` to elegantly enforce this minimum without additional code complexity.
- Realized that edge cases like this highlight the importance of balancing theoretical test cases with practical, real-world application requirements.
- This approach prevents potential errors in the UI and ensures the application always provides meaningful results to users.
- Confirmed proper functionality by running the full test suite, verifying all 17 tests now pass successfully.

### Test Suite Implementation & Code Abstraction

- Faced an unexpected issue during in-person inventory organization with a friend - the system had problems that forced us to stop working.
- Realized that real-world testing with limited time availability can be costly when bugs arise - my friend had to leave before we completed the task.
- Decided to implement a comprehensive testing suite to validate different scenarios without requiring physical testing:
  - Created dedicated test files for core business logic
  - Added unit tests covering all critical functions
  - Implemented edge case tests (like the minimum shelf requirement)
  - Ensured test coverage for inventory management, search, and distribution algorithms
- Abstracted business logic from UI components to make testing easier:
  - Moved all data manipulation into the dedicated `SpiceLogic` class
  - Separated concerns between UI rendering and core functionality
  - Created clear interfaces for data structures
  - Implemented pure functions for distribution calculations
- This separation allowed for isolated testing of business logic without UI dependencies.
- The test suite now serves as living documentation of expected behavior and guards against regression.
- Gained important insight: thorough testing before real-world application saves significant time and prevents frustrating interruptions, especially when coordinating with other people.
- Confirmed the value of the abstraction when the test suite immediately caught an edge case (0 shelves) that would have caused problems in a real-world scenario.

### Improved Separation of Concerns

- Identified and fixed a critical architectural issue where data fetching logic was embedded directly in a React component's useEffect hook.
- Refactored the application to properly separate business logic from UI concerns:
  - Moved the `fetchSpicesFromMarkdown` and `fetchAndUpdateSpices` functions to the SpiceLogic class
  - Updated the UI component to use these methods instead of implementing its own fetching logic
  - Added comprehensive documentation to both files to clarify the separation of concerns
- This architectural improvement addressed a bug where the `fetchSpices` function was undefined when called from other parts of the component.
- Added clear JSDoc comments to prevent similar issues in the future, documenting that:
  - SpiceLogic class should contain ALL business logic (data fetching, manipulation, storage, validation)
  - React components should ONLY handle UI rendering, user interactions, and component-specific state
- The refactoring has several benefits:
  - Improved testability - business logic can now be tested independently from UI components
  - Better maintainability - changes to business logic don't require modifying UI code
  - Enhanced reusability - data fetching logic can now be used from anywhere in the application
  - Clearer error handling - any issues with data fetching are now handled consistently
- As a product engineer, I've learned that proper separation of concerns is essential even in smaller applications, as it prevents bugs and makes the code more maintainable as the application grows.
- This experience highlights that React's component model can inadvertently encourage mixing business logic with UI concerns, especially for developers who are still building familiarity with the framework.
- The addition of clear documentation serves as both a guide for future development and as a teaching tool for best practices in React architecture.

### Proper Name Capitalization Implementation

- Added consistent name capitalization rules to ensure spice names always follow proper conventions regardless of how users enter them.
- Implemented a sophisticated `properlyCapitalizeName` method in the SpiceLogic class that applies the following rules:
  - First letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., "Olive Oil" not "olive oil")
  - Known abbreviations like "BBQ", "MSG", and "CBD" are preserved in all-caps
  - Connector words like "and", "of", "with" are kept lowercase when not at the beginning of the name
  - Proper handling of extra whitespace in user input
  - Support for comma-separated formats (e.g., "Salt, Smoked" becomes "Salt, Smoked")
- Applied the capitalization logic consistently across all entry points:
  - When adding custom spices through direct text entry
  - When selecting spices from the predefined list
  - When adding spices through keyboard shortcuts
- This ensures a professionally formatted inventory regardless of how the user types in names.
- Added comprehensive test coverage for the capitalization feature:
  - Tests for standard capitalization cases
  - Tests for special abbreviations
  - Tests for comma-separated formats
  - Tests for lowercase connectors
  - Tests for whitespace handling
  - Tests for edge cases (empty strings, only whitespace)
- Verified that all tests pass successfully using our pnpm-based test suite with Vitest.
- This improvement addresses a subtle but important UX issue: users can type quickly without worrying about proper capitalization, yet the system maintains a polished, consistent presentation.
- As a product engineer, I've learned that these small refinements to data normalization significantly improve both the visual quality and perceived professionalism of even simple applications.
- The capitalization logic is an excellent example of moving business rules into the logic layer, further validating our earlier decision to abstract business logic away from UI components.
- I do wonder the effect of separating out the classes on LLMs. My guess is that we end up saving a fair amount on computation token costs because to reason over the logic doesn't always require processing UI tokens.

### Custom Spice Persistence System

- Identified a critical limitation in our current implementation: custom spices added through the interface are only stored in localStorage and don't persist to the canonical spicelist.md.
- This creates several issues:
  - Knowledge doesn't accumulate over time as users discover and add new spices
  - Custom additions are lost when clearing browser data or switching devices
  - The community benefit of crowd-sourced spice discovery is missed
- Designed a new persistence system with these components:
  - A server endpoint to receive and validate new spice submissions
  - A moderation queue to prevent duplicates and ensure quality
  - An update mechanism to safely modify the canonical markdown file
  - Proper categorization to maintain the "head noun first" convention
- This improvement represents a shift from a single-user tool to a collaborative system that gets better with use.
- As a product engineer, I've learned that data persistence architecture should consider not just individual user state, but also how to capture and preserve valuable user contributions for collective benefit.
- The new system balances ease of addition (users can still immediately use custom spices) with data integrity (submissions are validated before being added to the canonical source).

## April 27, 2025 (afternoon update)

### Custom Spice Persistence Improvements

- Implemented a Node.js server backend to allow custom spices to be saved back to the canonical spicelist.md file.
- Created a submission API that automatically adds custom spices to the appropriate category in the markdown file.
- Added proper business logic validation in the SpiceLogic class with a `spiceExistsInList` method to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Fixed a critical UX issue where partial matching was preventing legitimate new spices from being added (e.g., "Honey" was being blocked because "Honey Powder" existed).
- Updated the UI to provide clear feedback on submission status with intuitive status badges.
- Moved duplication checking from the server to the business logic layer in SpiceLogic, ensuring consistency across the application.
- This architecture enhancement represents a significant improvement in the system's ability to:
  - Preserve user knowledge across sessions and devices
  - Maintain a single source of truth for spice data
  - Prevent duplicate entries through proper validation
  - Provide clear feedback on submission status
- The implementation strikes a balance between immediate usefulness (custom spices are added to inventory right away) and long-term value (submissions are persisted to the canonical list).
- As a product engineer, I've learned that persisting user-generated content requires careful consideration of validation rules, file handling, and proper separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data storage layers.

### Final Bugfix: Addressing Function Scope Issues

- Fixed a persistent error with "fetchSpices is not defined" that appeared when submitting custom spices like "Strawberry Preserves".
- The root cause was a function scope issue: while we had properly moved data fetching to the SpiceLogic class, we were still trying to reference a now non-existent global function.
- Applied a clean solution by defining a local `loadSpices` function within the `submitCustomSpice` method that correctly leverages the SpiceLogic class methods.
- This approach maintains the separation of concerns while solving the reference error:
  - UI component still delegates all data fetching to SpiceLogic
  - The function exists only where it's needed, avoiding pollution of the component's scope
  - The solution respects React's functional component paradigm
- Learned an important lesson about function scope when refactoring: when moving functionality from one location to another, ensure all references are updated accordingly.
- This experience reinforced a critical React pattern: when defining helper functions that are only used in specific contexts, prefer defining them inline within those contexts rather than at the component level.
- The final product now correctly handles the full lifecycle of custom spices:
  1. User adds a custom spice to their inventory
  2. User submits the spice to be added to the canonical list
  3. The system persists it to the spicelist.md file
  4. The UI refreshes to show the updated list
  5. The spice becomes available to all users through the standard search
- This represents the completion of our data persistence journey, creating a system that properly balances immediate user utility with long-term knowledge preservation.
