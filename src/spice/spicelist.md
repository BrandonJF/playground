# Spice List

---

## CONTEXT & INSTRUCTIONS

- **What this is:**
  - The canonical, human-readable and machine-parseable list of all spices, blends, and seasonings used in the spice organizer project.
  - Written for both product engineers and AI systems to support search, organization, and inventory features.

- **How it's organized:**
  - Alphabetical by head noun (e.g., "Salt, Onion" not "Onion Salt").
  - Grouped by first letter, with each group headed by a single capital letter.
  - Each entry is a single line, with subtypes or descriptors after a comma.

- **How to use this file:**
  - Use as the single source of truth for all spice-related data in the project.
  - When updating the spice list, always follow the head noun first convention and avoid duplicates.
  - Both humans and AI systems should use this as the canonical data source for search, autocomplete, and organization logic.

- **How to add to it:**
  - Add new spices under the correct letter heading, using the head noun first format.
  - If a spice is a blend or has a descriptor, use a comma to separate (e.g., "Salt, Smoked").
  - Do not add duplicates or overly specific variants unless truly necessary for the project.
  - Keep entries concise and at the level of common kitchen usage.

- **Markers for tools:**
  - The main spice data begins after the line: `---`
  - Tools or scripts that load this file should skip everything before the first `---` marker.
  - Each group of entries is headed by a single capital letter for easy parsing.
